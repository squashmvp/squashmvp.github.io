        <h3>The Garden Rules!</h3>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in The Garden. The Garden is my
        original approach to an artistic showcase which can be populated by anyone
        for any purpose be it for marketing/advertising, artistic drive, or
        self-representation; presented in an ambient, realistic, and animated
        simulated environment using original assets, music, and sound.</p>

        <p>Basically, you want an image in The Garden? I'll put it in for my next
        animation. That's it. The size and image type depends on your patron tier.
        Depending on your tier, you get options. You get to keep it there for as long
        as you're a patron. There's rules. There's rules for all tiers. On top of that,
        each tier has its own set of rules. Check for tier info and rules just below!</p>

        <p><strong>Important</strong>! My contact options are limited. I will try
        to work with anyone as best as I can to the best of my ability considering
        the circumstances.</p>
